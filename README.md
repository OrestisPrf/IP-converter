# IP-converter
This is  a program written in  C language that converts an ip in decimal to its binary version and vice versa 
created by a team of software engineer students called Prof-IT for our first project.

## First Steps
The first thing ,that we came up to approach the situation was to find the algorithms that convert , a decimal number to a  binary and the other way around ,
and putting each of them to a separate function in our code .

### Our main fuction
After that we made our main function where we prompt our user to make a choice : 1 for converting decimal to binary and 2 to convert from binary to decimal.Next we used the switch case statement to define the desicion making .

In case1 we are letting the user to input a decimal adress by creating an array of 4 integers and with the help of the for loop we are calling the decimal to binary function tha we made earlier adding the dots in the required positions.By the time we get the output the function break we lead us out of that function .The same goes with the other fuction .

Lastly we have the default choice for our invalid choice

The programm first diplays the title of the project  and then receives the input of the user . To close the programm you have to press the enter button .
